## Customer Shopping Analysis

This project shows a complete data analytics process. It mirrors how analysts work in a corporate office. I analyzed customer shopping habits for a retail company. The goal was to find ways to increase sales and improve marketing.

The project follows a set path. It starts with business needs and moves to data cleaning. Then it uses SQL for analysis and Power BI for reporting.

### Business Needs

The company wants to see how customers shop. They looked at age, gender, and location. They also tracked product sizes, colors, and seasons.

One question guided the work. How can we use shopping data to improve marketing and product plans?

### Data Details
Each row shows the transaction happened with following details

* Customer age and gender.
* Product categories and colors.
* Purchase amounts and frequency.
* Discounts and shipping methods.
* Review ratings and subscription status.

### Tools Used

I used Python with Pandas for cleaning and initial math. PostgreSQL handled the business analysis through queries. Power BI created the final charts. I kept the code on GitHub.

### Data Cleaning

I checked the data for errors and fixed the structure. I filled missing values using the median for each category. I renamed columns to use lowercase and underscores.

Two new features were added. I grouped customers by age. I also changed text frequencies into numbers to show days between purchases. Finally, I deleted parts of the data that were not useful.

What was the result of these steps? The data became ready for deep analysis and clear reporting.

### SQL Analysis

I wrote queries to answer specific business questions. I calculated the revenue split by gender. I also found which high-spending customers ignore discounts.

 I compared revenue from subscribers against non-subscribers. This showed how much money repeat buyers bring to the company.

### Power BI Dashboard

I built an interactive dashboard for managers. It uses cards to show total customers and average spending.

Users can filter the data by gender or shipping type. The dashboard updates instantly when a filter changes. This helps the team make fast decisions based on facts.

### Key Results

The data revealed several trends. Customers who use express shipping spend more money on average. Young adults bring in more revenue than other age groups.

Many loyal customers are not yet subscribers. This is a chance to grow the subscription program. Some products only sell well when the company offers a discount.
